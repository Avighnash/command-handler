# child-commands [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OutdatedVersion/child-commands.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OutdatedVersion/child-commands)
Demonstration of creating a sub-command system using the Spigot API.

As discussed [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/subcommands.138836) this
is a parent/child command relation system designed to create sub-commands
within their own individual classes. Now the only purpose I see to this is
orginization. Hopefully you find it useful for whatever you happen to be doing
though. :)
